## Python-API Guide

Cadwork offers an API (Application-Programming-Interface) for the programming language Python. 
Programming through the API allows you to create plugins and helper scripts with which, for example, operations can be automated.

Python is a programming language that is well suited for beginners, but also contains all the possibilities that professionals need.

## Rhino.Inside cadwork

Rhino.Inside cadwork is a tool that allows embedding Rhino 7 into cadwork 3D. Algorithms can be designed via Grasshopper, which then automate tasks in cadwork. 
Take advantage of surface modeling in your cadwork 3D environment.
