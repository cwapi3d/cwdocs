-   __Python-API Guide__

    ---

    Cadwork offers an API (Application-Programming-Interface) for the programming language Python. 
    Programming through the API allows you to create plugins and helper scripts with which, for example, operations can be automated.

    Python is a programming language that is well suited for beginners, but also contains all the possibilities that professionals need.
